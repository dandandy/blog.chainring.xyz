            Internet is a slippery service to track due to the fluctuating and intangible nature of internet access. Some may take their Internet Service Provider&rsquo;s (ISP) word that they are delivering internet performance that is up to the standard you are paying for, but not me. I can only shut my eyes at night with the confidence that my download and upload speeds, as well as latency, are up to scratch.

However, Bash scripting is notoriously difficult due to its extensive nature and large feature set, which often leads to developers writing poor scripts.
In this post, we will how explore you can write better Bash scripts with the help of The Set Builtin, Trapping Functions, Shellcheck, and Idempotency.
