        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            As a software developer, I am always looking for ways to automate mundane tasks in my life. As a casual athlete I am always looking for ways to show my support to my friends on Strava by kudos&rsquo;ing (ie. liking) their activities. So one day I thought why not automate my kudos&rsquo;ing activities on Strava. This blog post explains the method and code I used to create this kudos&rsquo;ing automation.

        <p>
            Internet is a slippery service to track due to the fluctuating and intangible nature of internet access. Some may take their Internet Service Provider&rsquo;s (ISP) word that they are delivering internet performance that is up to the standard you are paying for, but not me. I can only shut my eyes at night with the confidence that my download and upload speeds, as well as latency, are up to scratch.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is an incredibly common shell and scripting language in which any developer working on Linux and macOS based systems will inevitably come across. Because of this, Bash scripting skills are a formidible tool to have in your belt. However, Bash scripting is notoriously difficult due to its extensive nature and large feature set, which often leads to developers writing poor scripts.
In this post, we will how explore you can write better Bash scripts with the help of The Set Builtin, Trapping Functions, Shellcheck, and Idempotency.
